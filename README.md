## 👩‍💻 About Me 👋

With a strong foundation in **real estate business development, customer operations, and data analytics**, I'm now expanding into the world of **cybersecurity**—bringing a strategic, people-first lens to technical problem solving.

I’m passionate about understanding how **threats impact real systems**, and how business and security teams can collaborate to reduce risk and improve resilience.

🛠 I work across sectors—not switching industries, but building bridges between them.
